Android music player that shuffles right.

Flamenco is a music player for Android where shuffle works a little differently. Pressing the shuffle button for the first time will begin shuffle-playing the current queue, but it will also save that Shuffle for the future -- so every time you press the shuffle button after that, that Shuffle will be resumed from where you left off, even if you close and reopen the app. Now you can listen to your songs in random order without hearing some multiple times before hearing others.  
A shuffle can be deleted by pressing the trash button on the queue page, or saved as a playlist by pressing the add button.

Flamenco also allows users to create playlists, and contains a folder browser for finding music arranged by directory.
